# access - noseh

A simple syscall wrapper that requires no handles to perform operations with `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS` privilege.

This branch is the modified version that uses no SEH, but still does safe operations (results in slower execution). This branch also utilizes a different syscall hook for communication via a `.data` section modification in the kernel.

## Usage

1. Load the driver.
2. Load the DLL (wrapper) into a program that needs to open a handle to a protected process.
3. The program can now perform privileged operations without creating a real handle.

## Note

- The wrapper is designed to be loaded in a x64 process and only implements the syscalls that pertain to my workflow.
- Only tested on Windows 10 1903, 1809, and 1803.
